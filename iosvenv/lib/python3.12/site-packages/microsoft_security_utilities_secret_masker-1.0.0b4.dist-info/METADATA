Microsoft Security Utilities - Secret Masker
=============================================

microsoft-security-utilities-secret-masker is part of the Microsoft Security Utilities used internally. You can find the related .NET SDK package `here <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Security.Utilities>`_. This Secret Masker Python library focuses on:

- providing some built-in detection rules in json format
- detecting sensitive data for given input
- masking sensitive data with simple symbols or sha256 hash for given input

Installation
++++++++++++

You can install the package via pip:

::

    pip install microsoft-security-utilities-secret-masker


Usage
+++++

You can use the SecretMasker class to detect and mask sensitive data in your input. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

    from microsoft_security_utilities_secret_masker import SecretMasker, load_regex_patterns_from_json_file

    # Load built-in detection rules
    precisely_classified_regex_patterns = load_regex_patterns_from_json_file('PreciselyClassifiedSecurityKeys.json')
    unclassified_regex_patterns = load_regex_patterns_from_json_file('UnclassifiedPotentialSecurityKeys.json')
    # construct secret masker with chosen patterns
    regex_patterns = precisely_classified_regex_patterns.union(unclassified_regex_patterns)
    secret_masker = SecretMasker(regex_patterns)

    input = "This is a sample input with no secrets"
    detected_secrets = secret_masker.detect_secrets(input)
    processed_input = secret_masker.mask_secrets(input)
